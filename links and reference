some really useful info about I2C on Nick Gammon site.  it shows how to wire up an EEPROM and has a scanner program which will detect devices on the I2C bus.

finally, SD card information for Arduino.  Note that the Chip Select pin can be changed in the sketch.  I used pin 10 as it was easiest for me.
